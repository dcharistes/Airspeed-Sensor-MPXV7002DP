# Airspeed Sensor Programming
This code is running in an ESP32 to extract the differential pressure from MPXV7002DP and then calculate the speed of the vehicle. The construction of this process is done using two methods, the readPressure() and airspeed(). 
# Key-notes
The sensor has an analog output with a range of 0 to 4.5V corresponding to a differential pressure according to the transfer function provided by the datasheet. ESP32 has a maximum analog input voltage of 3.3V. So to read the full scale of the sensor we connected the output of MPXV7002DP to a voltage divider of ratio 3.3/4.5 with the appropriate resistors. To retrieve the actual voltage output of the sensor and calculate the differential pressure we divide the voltage reading from the corresponding ESP32 pin, with the ratio of the voltage divider. This pin is connected to the output of the voltage divider that is connected to the sensor. We divide with the ratio to get the full-scale output voltage of the sensor because the voltage reading input in ESP32 is mapped to 0 - 3.3V due to the voltage divider. After extracting the actual voltage output of the Airspeed sensor we apply the transfer function to find the differential pressure. Then we calculate the airspeed using the Bernoulli equation, in the airspeed() method.
