# Airspeed Sensor programming
The code running in ESP32 to extract the differential pressure from MPXV7002DP and then calculate the speed measured is constructed in two methods. The readPressure() and airspeed(). The sensor has an analog output with a range of 0 to 4.5V that corresponds to a differential pressure according to the transfer function provided from the datasheet. ESP32 has a maximum analog input voltage of 3.3V. So to read the full scale of the sensor we connected the output of MPXV7002DP to a voltage divider of ratio 3.3/4.5 with the apropriate resistors. To retrieve the actual voltage output of the sensor and calculate the differential pressure we divide the voltage reading of ESP32 (which is mapped to 0 - 3.3V), with the ratio of the voltage divider. After extracting the actual voltage output of the Airspeed sensor we apply the transfer function to find the differential pressure. Then we calculate the airspeed using the Bernouli equation, in the airspeed() method.
